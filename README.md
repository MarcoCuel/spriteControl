# spriteControl
jQuery sprite animation controlled by hover state.

##  Configure options:

>*	**step:** Set size in pixels for each frame.
>*	**allsteps:** All available steps in the sprite image in order to make the step animation. This number will be divided by steps; hence calculating background position.
>*	**loop:** Looping by default is false. Looping means will not stop at the last frame.
>*	**reverse:** By default is true. It means that on mouse out will will animate back until the first frame.
>*	**horizontalImg:** By default is true. Means that the sprite image is horizontal (landscape). While making it false, is for vertical sprite (portrait).
